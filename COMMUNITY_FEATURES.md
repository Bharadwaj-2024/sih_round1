## Technical Implementation

### State Management:

  userMemberships,
  joinCommunity,
  leaveCommunity,
  addCommunity,
  addDiscussion
} = useCommunityStore()
```

### Community Operations:
- **Join**: `joinCommunity(communityId, userId)`

- **Create**: `addCommunity(communityData)`
- **Search**: `searchCommunities(query)`

### Data Structure:
- Communities have members, posts, regions, categories

- Users have memberships and join requests tracked
